# TIGER CRANE KUNG FU PCB CARD
## A PCB buisness card with an NFC chip used to bring users to my kung fu school's website.
##### The purpose of this PCB is to act as a buisness card to premote my kung fu school Tiger Crane Kung Fu. The card has contact information and our adress printed onto it, aswell as a qr code that brings scanners to our website. The PCB also has an NFC chip inside of it that when tapped to a phone, will bring hte user to our website. Finally, an LED will light up on the card when the NFC is scanned. 

## Plan
##### Cost: $17.80 USD

## Design
##### I followed the tutorial above to make the schematic of the PCB, and that process was pretty smooth. I probably spent the most time designing the card itself, finding icons, and finding pictures, aswell as creating the routes.
